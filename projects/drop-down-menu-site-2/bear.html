                <h1>BEAR</h1>
                <p>
                    Bear is a 1 Year old Liger Cub!!
                <br>
                
                    Bear is saved from a zoo facility, 
                    that specialized in testing animals.
                    Bear seems to be lonely, and would really
                    like a family to feed him, and take him on long
                    walks within our wildlife facility. 
                
                <br>
                    Being once a lab experiment, he is now free to roam, 
                    and love as he pleases, in search for a pride to call his 
                    own. Bear also has a dissability where his wildlife
                    instincts, changed him more into a big house cat. 
                    He loves cuddles! with a supervisor on hand of course, then 
                    after a year of getting to know you , you can tend to him
                    without supervision.
