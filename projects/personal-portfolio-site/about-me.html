                    My Name is Sahlina Jenkins, I am a new up incoming 
                    Graphic 
                    Illustrator who does a bit of web design on the side.
                    I have had a 
                    passion for art as long as I could remember. After many
                    years of 
                    trial and error, going to different schools, I finally
                    attended 
                    a school which motivated me and inspired my art to grow
                    in a whole 
                    other direction. Being a single mother also helped grow
                    my art,
                    not to make it a whole sop story, my child inspires more
                    art and 
                    inspiration. My goal is to share my art, and Ideas with 
                    you the 
                    viewer. In hope that my art will reach you, into which
                    you will 
                    reach out to me. I hope you enjoy my many multi-joys.
