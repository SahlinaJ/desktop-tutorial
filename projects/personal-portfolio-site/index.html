                    <p>
                        My Name is Sahlina Jenkins, I am a new up incoming 
                        Graphic 
                        Illustrator who does a bit of web design on the side.
                        I have had a 
                        passion for art as long as I could remember. After many
                        years of 
                        trial and error, going to different schools, I finally
                        attended 
                        a school which motivated me and inspired my art to grow
                        in a whole 
                        other direction. Being a single mother also helped grow
                        my art,
                        not to make it a whole sop story, my child inspires more
                        art and 
                        inspiration. My goal is to share my art, and Ideas with 
                        you the 
                        viewer. In hope that my art will reach you, into which
                        you will 
                        reach out to me. I hope you enjoy my many multi-joys.

                            Product Photography is a lot  of fun, finding 
                            different landscapes and backgrounds to put a 
                            product in, inside and outside.

                            Portrait illustration, was always fun in my book,
                            I loved changing them freely into my own style of
                            cartoony character. Just by elaborating someone
                            elses features, into my own character.
