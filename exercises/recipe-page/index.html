         <h1>MAKING THE DOUGH</h1>
         <p>
            If you’ve made any sort of dough before, this recipe will be very
            easy. It is similar to other donut recipes on the blog and also
            the cinnamon roll recipe. The only difference is the dough will
            be a bit more sticky, it will have an extra egg and a bit more
            sugar, and a second rise is not needed. So let’s get into it!
         </p>

        
        <p>
            In a large mixing bowl, combine warm milk and active dry yeast,
            whisking until the yeast is dissolved and frothy. To this bubbly
            mixture, add granulated white sugar, salt, eggs, softened unsalted
            butter, and a dash of vanilla extract, creating a symphony of
             flavors that dance on your taste buds. The vanilla extract is
            not necessary but I like to add it to give it more flavor since
            the only thing we’ll add to the beignets is powdered sugar.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gradually incorporate all-purpose flour into the mixture, stirring
            continuously until a soft, slightly sticky dough forms. Knead the
            dough until it becomes smooth and elastic, a labor of love that
            ensures each donut is tender and airy. You can do this by hand in
            the bowl, with a rubber spatula, or with a stand mixer and hook
            attachment. Then transfer the dough to an oiled bowl and cover with
            saran wrap and a kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a warm,
            cozy spot until doubled in size, about 1 to 1.5 hours, a true
            testament to your patience!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>TIP:</b> To make ahead, prepare the dough up to the shaping
            stage, then cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate
            overnight. In the morning, simply allow the dough to come to room
            temperature before proceeding with frying.
        </p>

        <h1>SHAPING THE DONUTS</h1>
        <p>
            Once the dough has risen to perfection, gently punch it down to
            release any trapped air and then it’s time to roll and shape!
            Transfer the dough to a clean and floured surface. Use a rolling
            pin to roll out the dough into a square about 1/3 to 1/2 an inch
            thick. Then it’s time to cut and the best way to do this is with
            a pizza cutter. Cut the dough into squares about 2.5 x 2.5 inches.
            The shaping doesn’t have to be precise, they can have some rough
            edges and be different sizes. They will still taste just as good!
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that the donuts are cut, just cover them while we heat up the
            oil. A second proof is not necessary as said earlier but I like to
            let them rest just a bit only until the oil is hot enough to fry in,
            about 15 to 20 minutes.
        </p>
        <h1>FRYING THE DONUT</h1>
        <p>
            In a deep pot or fryer pan, heat vegetable oil to 350°F. You can
            also use peanut oil or canola oil. Carefully lower a few donuts
            into the oil, about 4 to 6, ensuring they have ample space to dance
            and sizzle to perfection. As the donuts fry, they will start to
            puff and fill up with air and it’s just the most magical fun thing
            to watch. Once golden on one side, flip over and allow the other
            side to crisp up to golden perfection. Remove from the oil and
            transfer to a wire rack to let any excess oil drain out. Fry the
            remaining donuts and repeat the same process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finish the beignets off with a generous dusting of powdered sugar
            and enjoy them warm for maximum enjoyment!

        <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
        <h4>MAKE THE DOUGH</h4>
        <p>
         <ol>
            <li>
                In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm milk and active dry
                yeast. Whisk together until the yeast is dissolved. Allow it to
                sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.
            </li>
        <br>
            <li>
                To the yeast mixture, add the granulated white sugar, salt,
                eggs, softened unsalted butter, and vanilla extract.
                Mix well until all the ingredients are combined.
            </li>
        <br>
            <li>
                Gradually add the all-purpose flour to the mixture, stirring
                continuously until a dough forms. It will be very soft and a
                bit sticky.
            </li>
        <br>
            <li>
                Knead the dough for about 3 to 4 minutes until it becomes
                smooth and elastic. You can use your hand, a wooden spatula,
                or a stand mixer with the hook attachment.
            </li>
        <br>
            <li>
                Place the kneaded dough into a lightly greased bowl,
                cover it with plastic wrap and a clean kitchen towel, 
                and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours,
                or until it doubles in size.
            </li>
         </ol>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>SHAPE THE DONUT</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air.
                Transfer it to a clean and floured surface.
            </li>
        <br>
            <li>
            Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air.
            Transfer it to a clean and floured surface.
            </li>
        <br>
            <li>
                Roll out the dough to about 1/2 inch thickness into a large
                square. Use a pizza cutter to cut squares about the size of 
                2.5 by 2.5 inches.
            </li> 
        <br>
            <li>
                Cover them with a clean kitchen towel and let them rise again
                but this time only for about 15 to 20 minutes, just while the
                oil heats up.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>FRY THE DONUT</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a deep pot or fryer pan, heat vegetable oil to 
                350°F (175°C).
            </li>
        <br>
            <li>
                Carefully add a few donuts to the hot oil, making sure not to
                overcrowd the pot. Fry for about 1-2 minutes on each side,
                or until they turn golden brown.
            </li>
        <br>
            <li>
                Once fried, remove the donuts from the oil using a slotted
                spoon and place them on a wire rack to drain any excess oil.
            </li> 
        <br>
            <li>
                Repeat the frying process with the remaining donuts.
            </li>
        <br>
            <li>
                Once all the donuts are fried and cooled slightly, 
                dust them very generously with powdered sugar to enjoy warm.
            </li>
