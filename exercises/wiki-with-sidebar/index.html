                    Black Myth: Wukong is an action role-playing game,[3][4][5]
                    [6] with soulslike elements.[4][7][8] It is a single-player 
                    game[9][10][6] played from a third-person perspective.[5]
                    It is inspired by the classical Chinese novel Journey to 
                    he West.[3][7][5][11]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The player controls a monkey protagonist
                    referred to as the Destined One, who is based on 
                    Sun Wukong from the novel.[7][6] The protagonist's weapon
                    is a staff, which is based on the Ruyi Jingu Bang from the 
                    novel.[7][12] The staff can extend and shrink in size 
                    during combat.[7] The three staff stances, which are the
                    smash stance, the pillar stance, and the thrust stance,
                    provide versatility in fights.[6][13][11] The combat
                    mechanics involve the management of resources.[8] 
                    Focus can be accumulated by landing light attacks,
                    executing well-timed dodges, and other means.[14] A focus
                    point is gained when the meter for focus is filled up.[8] 
                    These points can be used to initiate a varied combo, chained
                    to light attacks, or to charge a heavy attack on its 
                    own.[8] Stamina depletes by sprinting, dodging, and 
                    attacking.[15]   
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Spells have cooldowns before they can be cast again and
                    consume mana.[5][7] They are categorized in mysticism, 
                    alteration, strand, and transformations.[17] 
                    The protagonist uses transformations to shapeshift into a 
                    different creature or being.[3][7] An example is the 
                    transformation Red Tides, which takes the form of Guangzhi,
                    a wolfman who wields a flaming glaive.
                    [7] The transformations come with their own movesets 
                    and health.[3][7] They are available on cooldown, but do 
                    not cost mana.[8] They last until their might, which 
                    depletes by attacking, or health runs out.[7]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Spirits provide a skill and passive effect if
                    they are equipped.[18] Spirit skills function as 
                    transformations to do a single attack.[8] They are 
                    available on cooldown[8] and consume qi.[5] Spirits 
                    come from certain defeated enemies and are acquired if 
                    they are absorbed into a gourd.[18] An example of a spirit 
                    is the Wandering Wight, who does a headbutt attack.[8][18]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game follows a mostly linear progression interspersed
                    with expansive areas.[7] There are keeper's shrines, 
                    which act as checkpoints for the player, along the way.[19]
                    Throughout the world, the protagonist encounters various
                    yaoguai as enemies.[3][7] The game's difficulty cannot be
                    changed by players, but it does not remain the same
                    throughout a playthrough.[20]

                <h4><b>Premise and Setting</b></h4>
                <p>
                    Black Myth: Wukong is an action role-playing game,[3][4][5]
                    [6] with soulslike elements.[4][7][8] It is a single-player 
                    game[9][10][6] played from a third-person perspective.[5]
                    It is inspired by the classical Chinese novel Journey to 
                    he West.[3][7][5][11]
                </p>
                <h4><b>Plot</b></h4>
                <p>
                    After successfully escorting Tang Sanzang and recovering the
                    Buddhist scriptures, Sun Wukong ascends to Buddhahood, but
                    ultimately rejects life in the Celestial Court, instead 
                    choosing to live on his mountain in peace. However, the 
                    Celestial Court is angered that Sun Wukong would disobey 
                    them and sends an army led by Erlang Shen to force him to 
                    return to the Court. Sun Wukong duels Erlang, but is 
                    incapacitated by the circlet that binds him to the Court 
                    and is sealed in a stone. However, right before he is 
                    sealed, Sun Wukong manages to split his power into six 
                    Relics, each one corresponding to one of Wukong's six 
                    senses that are scattered and hidden all across China.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Over the next few centuries, the Monkeys of Mount Huaguo
                    would send out a number of young warriors to try and 
                    recover the Relics so they can revive and free Sun Wukong.
                    One such Monkey (who becomes known as the Destined One) 
                    sets out on his quest to find the Relics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First Relic: He first heads to the burnt down ruins 
                    of Guanyin Temple and recovers the first Relic, 
                    Sun Wukong's "eyes", by defeating Heifeng Guai, 
                    who apologizes and claims he was forced by the Court 
                    to oppose the Destined One.
                </p>
                 <p>
                    Second Relic: The Destined One then heads to Yellow Wind
                    Ridge where he defeats the Yellow Wind Sage and 
                    recovers the severed head of the Bodhisattva Lingji. 
                    As an appreciative gesture, Lingji hands over the 
                    second Relic which he had guarded until then.
                    Third Relic: The Destined One continues his journey 
                    to the mountains, where he frees Zhu Bajie from 
                    imprisonment and they both defeat Yellowbrow.
                    Maitreya proceeds to thank them for defeating Yellowbrow, 
                    who stole his artifacts as well as the third Relic, 
                    which he then gives to the Destined One.
                    Fourth Relic: The Destined One and Bajie then arrive at the
                    lair of the Spider Demons to find the fourth Relic, 
                    but Bajie is captured by the matriarch, the Violet Spider, who plans to marry and devour him for having "ruined" her centuries earlier. The Destined One rescues Bajie and battles both the Violet Spider and the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master, resulting in their deaths and the acquisition of the fourth Relic.
                    Fifth Relic: The Destined One and Bajie continue to the 
                    Forest of Embers, where they find the Red Boy attempting 
                    to steal the fifth Relic from the Bull Demon King. 
                    The Destined One defeats Red Boy, who then commits suicide
                    to avoid the humiliation of defeat. This enables
                    the Destined One to take possession of the fifth Relic.
                    Sixth Relic: With five of the Relics now in possession,
                    the Destined One and Bajie return to Mount Huaguo to find 
                    the sixth and final Relic. On the way, they find that Sun 
                    Wukong's old weapon, armour and cloud have been hidden 
                    in the region, thus they decide to recover them before 
                    the Court does. They reach the summit of Mount Huaguo 
                    where the Destined One discovers that, as the
                    "Destined One", he himself is the sixth Relic,
                    also known as Sun Wukong's mind, hence why the 
                    "Destined One" resembles Wukong exactly. In fact, 
                    his true destiny is not to revive Sun Wukong per se,
                    but to inherit the legacy of his name and powers,
                    thus becoming his new incarnation.
                    Endings In order to achieve reincarnation, 
                    the Destined One is forced to battle the stone 
                    body of Sun Wukong, who has no mind and no soul. 
                    Upon the defeat of Wukong's stone body, there exist
                    multiple endings:
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    If the Destined One did not fulfill any of the
                    optional requirements for other endings, he fails
                    to inherit Sun Wukong's legacy. He is forced to wear 
                    the same circlet that bound Sun Wukong to the Celestial 
                    Court and his body remains trapped inside the rock waiting
                    for a new Destined One.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    If the Destined One defeated Erlang Shen in an 
                    optional boss fight prior to the final battle, 
                    he successfully inherits Sun Wukong's memories and 
                    refuses to wear the circlet, preventing himself from 
                    being bound to the Celestial Court.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    Black Myth: Wukong is a game developed and published by 
                    Game Science.[12][26][6] Several members of Game Science,
                    founded in Shenzhen, moved to Hangzhou to begin development
                    of the game in 2018.[2] The team considered the cost for
                    research and development to be high from the start of the
                    project, so they did not have high expectations for
                    profitability initially.[25] Nevertheless, they wanted to 
                    create a single-player game in their own style with a focus
                    on traditional cultural themes.[25] They had discussed 
                    themes such as xianxia and wuxia, but were most 
                    enthusiastic about the Journey to the West.[27]
