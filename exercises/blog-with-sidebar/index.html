                        Dear Women who painstakingly gave me life, 
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        to whom I call mother. You have shown me 
                        the romances from the seed bearer to which male 
                        counterpart who so happens to be called father. 
                        I write to you, to inform that your love had 
                        been a deceptful rue to coax you into a forever 
                        bondage that
                        we call marriage. The letter presented at the bottom. 
                        is no 
                        other than an extravagent hoax of song, formed as a
                        letter, 
                        inorder to covet you to one day concieve me. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is with my humblest apologies that, the gift you had 
                        beared unfortunately cannot be returned to sender, 
                        and just a friendly reminder to always do your 
                        research beforehand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        p.s 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        if it makes you feel better , we were both decieved. 
                        Considering this act of love was only created from 
                        laziness, you should have noticed the signs 
                        during the marriage.

                        <h3>To the One I love</h3>
                        <p>
                            There used to be a graying tower
                            alone on the sea
                            You became the light on the dark side of me
                            Love remained a drug that's the high and 
                            not the pill
                            But did you know that when it snows
                            My eyes become large and the light that you 
                            shine can 
                            be seen?   
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose 
                            on the gray
                            the more   I get of you, the stranger it feels, 
                            And now that your rose is in bloom
                            A light hits the gloom on the gray   
                        </p>    
                        <p>
                            There is so much a man can tell you,
                            so much he can say
                            You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain, baby
                            To me you're like a growing addiction that 
                            I can't deny
                            Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?
                            But did you know that when it snows
                            My eyes become large and the light that you 
                            shine can 
                            be seen?
                            I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
                            Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger 
                            it feels,
                            Now that your rose is in bloom
                            A light hits the gloom on the gray

                        <p>
                            Yes, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on
                            the gray
                            Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger
                            it feels, yeah
                            Now that your rose is in bloom
